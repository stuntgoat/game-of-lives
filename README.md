**Game of Lives**

Based on [Conrad's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life "Game of Life on Wikipedia").

Long term goals for this project are to have multiple states running on the same matrix. I am thinking of a way that so the cells that appear will inherit characteristics from the 'parent' cells( those that were nearby to create them ).

    $ python gol.py

The above command will create a Game of Life a 45 x 45 matrix with 'X' and 'O' running at 2 speeds.
