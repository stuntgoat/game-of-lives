**Game of Lives**

Based on [Conrad's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life "Game of Life on Wikipedia").

Long term goals for this project are to have multiple states running on the same matrix, and influence each other's state when they come in contact with cells in other states.. I am considering a way to make new cells inherit characteristics from the 'parent' cells( those that were nearby to create them ). 

    $ python gol.py

The above command will create a Game of Life inside 45 x 45 matrix with 'X' and 'O' running at 2 speeds.
